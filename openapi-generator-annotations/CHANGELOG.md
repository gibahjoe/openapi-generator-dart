## [5.0.2](https://github.com/gibahjoe/openapi-generator-dart/compare/v5.0.0...v5.0.2) (2024-01-16)

### Bug Fixes

* fixed spec diff tracking

## [6.0.0](https://github.com/gibahjoe/openapi-generator-dart/compare/v5.0.3...v6.0.0) (2024-11-06)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* `forceAlwaysRun` is used to represent if the library should run  everytime `build_runner` is executed. This is done by modifying the annotated file after `build_runner` completes. Previous versions of this library did not have this flag but they had the equivalent of `true`. However, this now defaults to `false`. To keep previous behavior, set this flag to `true`.

### Features

* add --name-mappings param support for generator ([f5c6aed](https://github.com/gibahjoe/openapi-generator-dart/commit/f5c6aed0408de33c8f273f6e21aacb42a34cbbc1))

## 4.12.0

- Added spec diff tracking. This means you Openapi generator now tracks changes to your spec and only regenerates the
  code if there are changes. This is useful if you have a large spec and you want to avoid regenerating the code every
  time you run your build. This is enabled by default. You can read more about it [here](../README.md#next-generation).
